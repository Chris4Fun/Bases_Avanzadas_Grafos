## AuraDB Graph Database with Python API

This project demonstrates how to use [AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/)—a fully managed graph database service—with a Python API. The goal is to show how graph databases can be integrated into modern applications for advanced data modeling and querying.

### Features
- Connects to AuraDB using Python
- Provides a RESTful API for graph operations
- Example endpoints for creating nodes, relationships, and querying the graph

### Technologies Used
- **AuraDB (Neo4j Cloud)**: Managed graph database
- **Python**: API development
- **neo4j Python Driver**: Connects Python to AuraDB


### Steps

- If not enabled, enable running scripts in shell with the following command: **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force**
- If on windows run: .\run.ps1 on Max run: .\run.sh
- It'll install dependencies and run the server for the API
